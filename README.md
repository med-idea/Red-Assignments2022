There was an issue with importing the excel file when it was named _4- BOBİ FRS Nakit Akış Tablosu - Dolaylı Yöntem (Konsolide)_ because of the turkish characters.

Caseware IDEA was not able to recognize the file or the sheet within (for the same reason of existence of the turkish characters).

So i just changed the name of the excel file to _test2.xlsx_ and the name of the excel sheet to _Sheet1_, that eliminated the problem with the turkish characters, and the script works properly
